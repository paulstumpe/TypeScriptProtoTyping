/**
 * For some games I want to show coordinates to the player, and those will probably not
 * be cube, but instead axial or offset, so I’ll need a data structure for the player-visible
 * coordinate system, as well as functions for converting back and forth. Cube
 * and axial are basically the same so I’m not going to bother implementing a separate
 * axial system, and I’ll reuse Hex.
 * For offset coordinates, I’ll make a separate data structure Offset.
